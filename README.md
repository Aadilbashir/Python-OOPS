# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

Welcome to the **OOPs in Python** repo — a hands-on playground to master Object-Oriented Programming concepts the right way.  
This repo covers everything from the basic building blocks (classes and objects) to advanced concepts like abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism — all with clean, practical examples.

## What’s Inside

Here’s what you’ll find in this repo:

- **Classes & Objects** — Learn how Python structures data and behavior.
- **Encapsulation** — Keep your data safe and private.
- **Inheritance** — Reuse and extend code like a pro.
- **Polymorphism** — Write flexible, scalable methods.
- **Abstraction** — Simplify complexity with clear design.
- **Real-world Examples** — Learn by actually coding small OOP-based projects.
